We are working on data about accidents in the victorian state from year 1987 to 2013 (Australia)
The goal here is to identify leverages of action to prevent severe accidents to occue by :
- Understanding the spatial distribution of accidents
- Understanding factors that impact on an accident severity

### How to use : 
0. pip install -r requirements.txt
1. Set the path to your raw data folder changing "DATA_ROOTFOLDER" variable
2. run generate_preprocessed_data.py to generate processed data 
3. 2 files are then using that data to make some analysis : 
feature_selection.py and hot_spots.ipynb
feature_selection.py reveals how we selected 

NOTE: The rest of files are notebooks only used for a better representation of what we are talking about. They can be considered as exploratory drafts
