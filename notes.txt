atm cond : ok => granularity= accident + seq => modified to accident
road cond : ok => granularity= accident + seq => modified to accident
nodes : ok => granularity= accident + post code => modified to accident
accident : ok => granularity= accident 
subdca : ok => in the end not used because describes the serie of events after the accident
person : ok 
location : ok
vehicle : ok

for person data : we don't need as much detail. But we would like to see if the age of the driver has an impact on the severity. 
(it could be interesting to see the impact of the seatbelt, but we don't have that data avaliable)

for vehicle we could look at the age of the vehicle


hypothesis : when there is a sequence, we just look at one event (the last) : sub_dca, road_cond
